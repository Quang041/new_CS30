Program: WordGuess.java          Last Date of this Revision: April 2, 2026

Purpose: Modify the WordGuess case study from Chapter 5 to use a word from a file as the secret word.
The file should contain a list of words, with one word per line. The WordGuess application should 
determine which word to use, by generating a random number that corresponds to one of the word in the
fil

             How to play
--------------------------------------
* Enter a letter for your guess.
* Hit '!' to guess the entire word.
* If you put in 2 characters, we count
the first one.
* Just guess the word I give you.
P/S: It's not that hard, trust.
